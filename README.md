# QuestsChanged

Developer tool for tracking quests as you complete them... including the hidden behind the scenes tracking quests for objects/mobs.

I use it to work on my HandyNotes plugins, because the tracking quests are hard to work out otherwise.

This provides a DataBroker plugin to display the data.

If you don't have a broker viewer installed, type /questschanged to show the log.

You can also type /questschanged icon to toggle a minimap icon.
